In the following work, I am using Marker_option = 2 and without any center weighting factor, so weightfac = 1. 
- I checked that when there is no center weighting factor, with set = 1, the ratio between the given number of markers and the good final selected markers is the same, as that of the initial rectangular RZ grid and the selected good RZ grid. It is about 0.4772. (NZ = 100, NR = 50)
    - Now I vary the number of RZ poitns and see if it still holds: NZ = 50, NR = 25. Ratio is: 0.4672, the same 
    - Maybe make the ratio slight off? NZ = 51, NR = 25. Ratio is 0.46509803921568627
