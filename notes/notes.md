- **Markers weight**: when we create the ensemble of all the markers. Most fusion happens at the center, fusions are the source of alpha particles. The volumn metric of the source rate of the the alpha particles are 10^100 times stronger in the middle than in the edge.  When we create markers, we should follow more markers in the center, because that's where they are born. But by experience, only markers born from 0.7A to 1.0A could be lost. Even in this region, only about 10% of the particles could really get lost. What sccott did was that he created a uniformly distributed ensemble of particles. So we need to use the weight, to correct for this and get what the actual distribution is at the end. So, whenever we do a sum over all particles for some properties like the energy lost, we will need to multiply the property by its weight. 

- **Prompt losses**: Prompt losses in the context of tokamaks and other magnetic confinement fusion devices refer to particles that escape from the plasma confinement almost immediately after being introduced or created in the plasma, without completing a full toroidal transit.

    This is often associated with energetic particles such as fusion products or injected neutral beam ions. If these particles are born or injected with velocities that point largely towards the plasma edge, or if their pitch angles (the angle between their velocity and the magnetic field) are unfavorable, they can immediately hit the wall of the tokamak and be lost from the plasma.

    Prompt losses can pose a challenge in fusion reactors for several reasons. Firstly, they represent a loss of heating power, because the energy of the lost particles is not retained in the plasma to heat it. Secondly, these lost particles can cause damage to the tokamak walls, particularly in a reactor environment where the flux of energetic particles is high. Thus, understanding and minimizing prompt losses is an important aspect of fusion reactor design and operation.

    **The physics of the the prompt losses and the non-prompt losses are quite different, inlcuding their inpact on the wall** For SPACR, the threshhold time after which the losses are non-pormpt is about 30ms, which is the default in the `pnp_losses.py`. 

- **fn_geqdsk**: The 'g' stands for g-file, which is a type of file that stores data for equilibrium plasma configurations. The 'eqdsk' stands for 'equilibrium desk', which is a slightly archaic term used to describe a data table or file (desk here is not referring to a physical desk but is rather an old term for a set of data).
