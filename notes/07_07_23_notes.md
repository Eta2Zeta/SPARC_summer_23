So here, I have run the exact same runs that steve run and failed, but they ran OK, which is very surprising

Each line of this output provides information about different tasks associated with a single job run on Perlmutter. Here's what each line represents:

- First line (11275731 perlmutte+ regular_m+ 256 COMPLETED 78848 00:05:08): This line represents the overall job. The JobID is 11275731, the JobName is perlmutte+, the Partition is regular_m+, the job used 256 allocated CPU cores (AllocCPUS), the State is COMPLETED, the CPUTimeRAW (total CPU time used by all cores) is 78848 seconds, and the Elapsed wall-clock time (real time from start to finish) is 00:05:08 (hh:mm:ss).
- Second line (11275731.ba+ batch 256 COMPLETED 78848 00:05:08): This line represents the batch script that was submitted to the scheduler. The batch script contains the commands that were executed for this job. The time and CPU usage for the batch script are typically similar to those for the overall job, as seen here.
- Third line (11275731.ex+ extern 256 COMPLETED 101632 00:06:37): This line represents "external" processes or tasks that were running during your job but were not part of the job itself. This could include system processes or other background tasks. The time and CPU usage for these tasks are included separately.
- Fourth line (11275731.0 hydra_bst+ 128 COMPLETED 45696 00:05:57): This line represents a specific task that was part of the job, namely hydra_bst+. This task used 128 cores. The time and CPU usage for this task are included separately.
