NAME
       sbatch - Submit a batch script to Slurm.

SYNOPSIS
       sbatch [OPTIONS(0)...] [ : [OPTIONS(N)...]] script(0) [args(0)...]

       Option(s) define multiple jobs in a co-scheduled heterogeneous job.  For more details about heterogeneous jobs see the document
       https://slurm.schedmd.com/heterogeneous_jobs.html

DESCRIPTION
       sbatch  submits  a  batch script to Slurm.  The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified,
       sbatch will read in a script from standard input. The batch script may contain options preceded with "#SBATCH" before any executable commands in the  script.
       sbatch will stop processing further #SBATCH directives once the first non-comment non-whitespace line has been reached in the script.

       sbatch exits immediately after the script is successfully transferred to the Slurm controller and assigned a Slurm job ID.  The batch script is not necessar-
       ily granted resources immediately, it may sit in the queue of pending jobs for some time before its required resources become available.

       By default both standard output and standard error are directed to a file of the name "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced with the job allocation num-
       ber. The file will be generated on the first node of the job allocation.  Other than the batch script itself, Slurm does no movement of user files.

       When  the  job  allocation  is  finally  granted for the batch script, Slurm runs a single copy of the batch script on the first node in the set of allocated
       nodes.

       The following document describes the influence of various options on the allocation of cpus to jobs and tasks.
       https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html

RETURN VALUE
       sbatch will return 0 on success or error code on failure.

SCRIPT PATH RESOLUTION
       The batch script is resolved in the following order:

       1. If script starts with ".", then path is constructed as: current working directory / script
       2. If script starts with a "/", then path is considered absolute.
       3. If script is in current working directory.
       4. If script can be resolved through PATH. See path_resolution(7).

       Current working directory is the calling process working directory unless the --chdir argument is passed, which will override the current working directory.

OPTIONS
       -A, --account=<account>
              Charge resources used by this job to specified account.  The account is an arbitrary string. The account name may be changed after job submission  us-
              ing the scontrol command.

       --acctg-freq=<datatype>=<interval>[,<datatype>=<interval>...]
              Define  the  job  accounting  and  profiling  sampling intervals in seconds.  This can be used to override the JobAcctGatherFrequency parameter in the
              slurm.conf file.  <datatype>=<interval> specifies the task sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugin or a sampling interval for a profiling type
              by the acct_gather_profile plugin. Multiple comma-separated <datatype>=<interval> pairs may be specified. Supported datatype values are:

              task        Sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugins and for task profiling by the acct_gather_profile plugin.
                          NOTE:  This  frequency is used to monitor memory usage. If memory limits are enforced, the highest frequency a user can request is what is
                          configured in the slurm.conf file.  It can not be disabled.

              energy      Sampling interval for energy profiling using the acct_gather_energy plugin.

              network     Sampling interval for infiniband profiling using the acct_gather_interconnect plugin.

              filesystem  Sampling interval for filesystem profiling using the acct_gather_filesystem plugin.

              The default value for the task sampling interval is 30 seconds.  The default value for all other intervals is 0.  An interval of 0  disables  sampling
              of  the  specified type.  If the task sampling interval is 0, accounting information is collected only at job termination (reducing Slurm interference
              with the job).
              Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance, but a value of 30 seconds is not likely to be noticeable for applications having
              less than 10,000 tasks.

       -a, --array=<indexes>
              Submit  a  job  array, multiple jobs to be executed with identical parameters.  The indexes specification identifies what array index values should be
              used. Multiple values may be specified using a comma separated list and/or a range of values with a "-"  separator.  For  example,  "--array=0-15"  or
              "--array=0,6,16-32".   A  step function can also be specified with a suffix containing a colon and number. For example, "--array=0-15:4" is equivalent
              to "--array=0,4,8,12".  A maximum number of simultaneously running tasks from the job array may be specified  using  a  "%"  separator.   For  example
              "--array=0-15%4"  will limit the number of simultaneously running tasks from this job array to 4.  The minimum index value is 0.  the maximum value is
              one less than the configuration parameter MaxArraySize.  NOTE: currently, federated job arrays only run on the local cluster.

       --batch=<list>
              Nodes can have features assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify which of these features are required by their batch script us-
              ing  this  options.   For  example a job's allocation may include both Intel Haswell and KNL nodes with features "haswell" and "knl" respectively.  On
              such a configuration the batch script would normally benefit by executing on a faster  Haswell  node.   This  would  be  specified  using  the  option
              "--batch=haswell".    The  specification  can  include  AND  and  OR  operators  using  the  ampersand  and  vertical  bar  separators.  For  example:
              "--batch=haswell|broadwell" or "--batch=haswell|big_memory".  The --batch argument must be a subset of the job's  --constraint=<list>  argument  (i.e.
              the  job can not request only KNL nodes, but require the script to execute on a Haswell node).  If the request can not be satisfied from the resources
              allocated to the job, the batch script will execute on the first node of the job allocation.

       --bb=<spec>
              Burst buffer specification. The form of the specification is system dependent.  Also see --bbf.  When the --bb option is used, Slurm parses  this  op-
              tion and creates a temporary burst buffer script file that is used internally by the burst buffer plugins. See Slurm's burst buffer guide for more in-
              formation and examples:
              https://slurm.schedmd.com/burst_buffer.html

       --bbf=<file_name>
              Path of file containing burst buffer specification.  The form of the specification is system dependent.  These burst buffer  directives  will  be  in-
              serted into the submitted batch script.  See Slurm's burst buffer guide for more information and examples:
              https://slurm.schedmd.com/burst_buffer.html

       -b, --begin=<time>
              Submit  the batch script to the Slurm controller immediately, like normal, but tell the controller to defer the allocation of the job until the speci-
              fied time.

              Time may be of the form HH:MM:SS to run a job at a specific time of day (seconds are optional).  (If that time is already past, the next  day  is  as-
              sumed.)   You  may also specify midnight, noon, fika (3 PM) or teatime (4 PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the
              morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying a date of the form MMDDYY or MM/DD/YY YYYY-MM-DD.  Combine  date
              and  time using the following format YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be seconds
              (default), minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword today and to run the job tomorrow with the key-
              word tomorrow.  The value may be changed after job submission using the scontrol command.  For example:

                 --begin=16:00
                 --begin=now+1hour
                 --begin=now+60           (seconds by default)
                 --begin=2010-01-20T12:34:00

              Notes on date/time specifications:
               -  Although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the Slurm scheduler is not pre-
              cise enough to guarantee dispatch of the job on the exact second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll following  the  specified  time.
              The exact poll interval depends on the Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default sched/builtin).
               - If no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
               -  If  a  date  is  specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has already
              passed for that year, in which case the next year is used.

       -D, --chdir=<directory>
              Set the working directory of the batch script to directory before it is executed. The path can be specified as full path or relative path to  the  di-
              rectory where the command is executed.

       --cluster-constraint=[!]<list>
              Specifies  features  that a federated cluster must have to have a sibling job submitted to it. Slurm will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster
              if it has at least one of the specified features. If the "!" option is included, Slurm will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster that has none
              of the specified features.

       -M, --clusters=<string>
              Clusters  to  issue  commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.  The job will be submitted to the one cluster providing the earliest
              expected job initiation time. The default value is the current cluster. A value of 'all' will query to run on all clusters.  Note the --export  option
              to control environment variables exported between clusters.  Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

       --comment=<string>
              An arbitrary comment enclosed in double quotes if using spaces or some special characters.

       -C, --constraint=<list>
              Nodes  can  have  features assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify which of these features are required by their job using the
              constraint option. If you are looking for 'soft' constraints please see --prefer for more information.  Only nodes having features  matching  the  job
              constraints  will be used to satisfy the request.  Multiple constraints may be specified with AND, OR, matching OR, resource counts, etc. (some opera-
              tors are not supported on all system types).

              NOTE: Changeable features are features defined by a NodeFeatures plugin.

              Supported --constraint options include:

              Single Name
                     Only nodes which have the specified feature will be used.  For example, --constraint="intel"

              Node Count
                     A request can specify the number of nodes needed with some feature by appending an asterisk and count after the  feature  name.   For  example,
                     --nodes=16  --constraint="graphics*4 ..."  indicates that the job requires 16 nodes and that at least four of those nodes must have the feature
                     "graphics."  NOTE: This option is not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.  Heterogeneous jobs can be used instead.

              AND    Only nodes with all of specified features will be used.  The ampersand is used for an AND operator.  For example, --constraint="intel&gpu"

              OR     Only nodes with at least one of specified features will be used.  The vertical bar is used for an OR operator. If changeable features  are  not
                     requested, nodes in the allocation can have different features. For example, salloc -N2 --constraint="intel|amd" can result in a job allocation
                     where one node has the intel feature and the other node has the amd feature.  However, if the expression contains a  changeable  feature,  then
                     all  OR  operators are automatically treated as Matching OR so that all nodes in the job allocation have the same set of features. For example,
                     salloc -N2 --constraint="foo|bar&baz" The job is allocated two nodes where both nodes have foo, or bar and baz (one or both  nodes  could  have
                     foo,  bar,  and  baz).  The  helpers NodeFeatures plugin will find the first set of node features that matches all nodes in the job allocation;
                     these features are set as active  features  on  the  node  and  passed  to  RebootProgram  (see  slurm.conf(5))  and  the  helper  script  (see
                     helpers.conf(5)). In this case, the helpers plugin uses the first of "foo" or "bar,baz" that match the two nodes in the job allocation.

              Matching OR
                     If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square
                     brackets.  For example, --constraint="[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]" might be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack  of
                     the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.

              Multiple Counts
                     Specific  counts  of multiple resources may be specified by using the AND operator and enclosing the options within square brackets.  For exam-
                     ple, --constraint="[rack1*2&rack2*4]" might be used to specify that two nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature of "rack1" and four
                     nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature "rack2".

                     NOTE: This construct does not support multiple Intel KNL NUMA or MCDRAM modes. For example, while --constraint="[(knl&quad)*2&(knl&hemi)*4]" is
                     not supported, --constraint="[haswell*2&(knl&hemi)*4]" is supported.  Specification of multiple KNL modes requires the use of  a  heterogeneous
                     job.

                     NOTE: This option is not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.

                     NOTE: Multiple Counts can cause jobs to be allocated with a non-optimal network layout.

              Brackets
                     Brackets can be used to indicate that you are looking for a set of nodes with the different requirements contained within the brackets. For ex-
                     ample, --constraint="[(rack1|rack2)*1&(rack3)*2]" will get you one node with either the "rack1" or "rack2" features  and  two  nodes  with  the
                     "rack3" feature.  The same request without the brackets will try to find a single node that meets those requirements.

                     NOTE:  Brackets  are  only  reserved  for Multiple Counts and Matching OR syntax.  AND operators require a count for each feature inside square
                     brackets (i.e. "[quad*2&hemi*1]"). Slurm will only allow a single set of bracketed constraints per job.

                     NOTE: Square brackets are not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin. Matching OR can be requested without square brackets by  using  the
                     vertical bar character with at least one changeable feature.

              Parentheses
                     Parentheses  can be used to group like node features together. For example, --constraint="[(knl&snc4&flat)*4&haswell*1]" might be used to spec-
                     ify that four nodes with the features "knl", "snc4" and "flat" plus one node with the feature "haswell" are required.  Parentheses can also  be
                     used  to  group operations. Without parentheses, node features are parsed strictly from left to right.  For example, --constraint="foo&bar|baz"
                     requests nodes with foo and bar, or baz.  --constraint="foo|bar&baz" requests nodes with foo and baz, or bar and baz (note how  baz  was  AND'd
                     with everything).  --constraint="foo&(bar|baz)" requests nodes with foo and at least one of bar or baz.  NOTE: OR within parentheses should not
                     be used with a KNL NodeFeatures plugin but is supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.

       --container=<path_to_container>
              Absolute path to OCI container bundle.

       --container-id=<container_id>
              Unique name for OCI container.

       --contiguous
              If set, then the allocated nodes must form a contiguous set.

              NOTE: If SelectPlugin=cons_res this option won't be honored with the topology/tree or topology/3d_torus plugins, both of which can modify the node or-
              dering.

       -S, --core-spec=<num>
              Count  of  specialized  cores  per  node reserved by the job for system operations and not used by the application. The application will not use these
              cores, but will be charged for their allocation.  Default value is dependent upon the node's configured CoreSpecCount value.  If a value  of  zero  is
              designated  and  the Slurm configuration option AllowSpecResourcesUsage is enabled, the job will be allowed to override CoreSpecCount and use the spe-
              cialized resources on nodes it is allocated.  This option can not be used with the --thread-spec option.

              NOTE: Explicitly setting a job's specialized core value implicitly sets its --exclusive option, reserving entire nodes for the job.

       --cores-per-socket=<cores>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of cores per socket.  See  additional  information  under  -B  option  above  when
              task/affinity plugin is enabled.
              NOTE: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if -n was not specified) as one task per requested thread.

       --cpu-freq=<p1>[-p2[:p3]]

              Request  that  job steps initiated by srun commands inside this sbatch script be run at some requested frequency if possible, on the CPUs selected for
              the step on the compute node(s).

              p1 can be  [#### | low | medium | high | highm1] which will set the frequency scaling_speed to the corresponding value, and set  the  frequency  scal-
              ing_governor to UserSpace. See below for definition of the values.

              p1  can  be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave] which will set the scaling_governor to the corresponding value. The governor has to be
              in the list set by the slurm.conf option CpuFreqGovernors.

              When p2 is present, p1 will be the minimum scaling frequency and p2 will be the maximum scaling frequency.

              p2 can be  [#### | medium | high | highm1] p2 must be greater than p1.

              p3 can be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave | SchedUtil | UserSpace] which will set the governor to the corresponding value.

              If p3 is UserSpace, the frequency scaling_speed will be set by a power or energy aware scheduling strategy to a value between p1 and p2 that lets  the
              job run within the site's power goal. The job may be delayed if p1 is higher than a frequency that allows the job to run within the goal.

              If the current frequency is < min, it will be set to min. Likewise, if the current frequency is > max, it will be set to max.

              Acceptable values at present include:

              ####          frequency in kilohertz

              Low           the lowest available frequency

              High          the highest available frequency

              HighM1        (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency

              Medium        attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range

              Conservative  attempts to use the Conservative CPU governor

              OnDemand      attempts to use the OnDemand CPU governor (the default value)

              Performance   attempts to use the Performance CPU governor

              PowerSave     attempts to use the PowerSave CPU governor

              UserSpace     attempts to use the UserSpace CPU governor

       The following informational environment variable is set in the job step when --cpu-freq option is requested.
               SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ

       This  environment variable can also be used to supply the value for the CPU frequency request if it is set when the 'srun' command is issued.  The --cpu-freq
       on the command line will override the environment variable value.  The form on the environment variable is the same as the command line.  See the ENVIRONMENT
       VARIABLES section for a description of the SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ variable.

       NOTE:  This  parameter is treated as a request, not a requirement.  If the job step's node does not support setting the CPU frequency, or the requested value
       is outside the bounds of the legal frequencies, an error is logged, but the job step is allowed to continue.

       NOTE: Setting the frequency for just the CPUs of the job step implies that the tasks are confined to those CPUs.  If task confinement (i.e. the task/affinity
       TaskPlugin is enabled, or the task/cgroup TaskPlugin is enabled with "ConstrainCores=yes" set in cgroup.conf) is not configured, this parameter is ignored.

       NOTE: When the step completes, the frequency and governor of each selected CPU is reset to the previous values.

       NOTE:  When  submitting  jobs  with  the --cpu-freq option with linuxproc as the ProctrackType can cause jobs to run too quickly before Accounting is able to
       poll for job information. As a result not all of accounting information will be present.

       --cpus-per-gpu=<ncpus>
              Advise Slurm that ensuing job steps will require ncpus processors per allocated GPU.  Not compatible with the --cpus-per-task option.

       -c, --cpus-per-task=<ncpus>
              Advise the Slurm controller that ensuing job steps will require ncpus number of processors per task.  Without this option, the  controller  will  just
              try to allocate one processor per task.

              For instance, consider an application that has 4 tasks, each requiring 3 processors.  If our cluster is comprised of quad-processors nodes and we sim-
              ply ask for 12 processors, the controller might give us only 3 nodes.  However, by using the --cpus-per-task=3 options, the controller knows that each
              task requires 3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allocation of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

              NOTE: Beginning with 22.05, srun will not inherit the --cpus-per-task value requested by salloc or sbatch. It must be requested again with the call to
              srun or set with the SRUN_CPUS_PER_TASK environment variable if desired for the task(s).

       --deadline=<OPT>
              remove the job if no ending is possible before this deadline (start > (deadline - time[-min])).  Default is no deadline.  Valid time formats are:
              HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM]
              MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY]
              MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS]
              YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]]
              now[+count[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

       --delay-boot=<minutes>
              Do not reboot nodes in order to satisfied this job's feature specification if the job has been eligible to run for less than this time period.  If the
              job has waited for less than the specified period, it will use only nodes which already have the specified features.  The argument is in units of min-
              utes.  A default value may be set by a system administrator using the delay_boot option of the  SchedulerParameters  configuration  parameter  in  the
              slurm.conf file, otherwise the default value is zero (no delay).

       -d, --dependency=<dependency_list>
              Defer   the   start   of   this   job   until   the  specified  dependencies  have  been  satisfied  completed.   <dependency_list>  is  of  the  form
              <type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]> or <type:job_id[:job_id][?type:job_id[:job_id]]>.  All dependencies must be satisfied if the "," separa-
              tor is used.  Any dependency may be satisfied if the "?" separator is used.  Only one separator may be used. For instance:
              -d afterok:20:21,afterany:23

              means that the job can run only after a 0 return code of jobs 20 and 21 AND the completion of job 23. However:
              -d afterok:20:21?afterany:23
              means that any of the conditions (afterok:20 OR afterok:21 OR afterany:23) will be enough to release the job.  Many jobs can share the same dependency
              and these jobs may even belong to different  users. The  value may be changed after job submission using the scontrol command.  Dependencies on remote
              jobs  are  allowed in a federation.  Once a job dependency fails due to the termination state of a preceding job, the dependent job will never be run,
              even if the preceding job is requeued and has a different termination state in a subsequent execution.

              after:job_id[[+time][:jobid[+time]...]]
                     After the specified jobs start or are cancelled and 'time' in minutes from job start or cancellation happens, this job can begin execution.  If
                     no 'time' is given then there is no delay after start or cancellation.

              afterany:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.  This is the default dependency type.

              afterburstbuffer:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated and any associated burst buffer stage out operations have completed.

              aftercorr:job_id[:jobid...]
                     A task of this job array can begin execution after the corresponding task ID in the specified job has completed successfully (ran to completion
                     with an exit code of zero).

              afternotok:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state (non-zero exit code, node failure, timed out, etc).

              afterok:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).

              singleton
                     This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same job name and user have terminated.  In other words,  only  one
                     job by that name and owned by that user can be running or suspended at any point in time.  In a federation, a singleton dependency must be ful-
                     filled on all clusters unless DependencyParameters=disable_remote_singleton is used in slurm.conf.

       -m, --distribution={*|block|cyclic|arbitrary|plane=<size>}[:{*|block|cyclic|fcyclic}[:{*|block|cyclic|fcyclic}]][,{Pack|NoPack}]

              Specify alternate distribution methods for remote processes.  For job allocation, this sets environment variables that will be used by subsequent srun
              requests and also affects which cores will be selected for job allocation.

              This  option  controls the distribution of tasks to the nodes on which resources have been allocated, and the distribution of those resources to tasks
              for binding (task affinity). The first distribution method (before the first ":") controls the distribution of tasks to nodes.  The  second  distribu-
              tion  method (after the first ":") controls the distribution of allocated CPUs across sockets for binding to tasks. The third distribution method (af-
              ter the second ":") controls the distribution of allocated CPUs across cores for binding to tasks.  The second and third distributions apply  only  if
              task  affinity  is enabled.  The third distribution is supported only if the task/cgroup plugin is configured. The default value for each distribution
              type is specified by *.

              Note that with  select/cons_res  and  select/cons_tres,  the  number  of  CPUs  allocated  to  each  socket  and  node  may  be  different.  Refer  to
              https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html for more information on resource allocation, distribution of tasks to nodes, and binding of tasks to CPUs.
              First distribution method (distribution of tasks across nodes):

              *      Use the default method for distributing tasks to nodes (block).

              block  The  block distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that consecutive tasks share a node. For example, consider an allocation of
                     three nodes each with two cpus. A four-task block distribution request will distribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and two  on  the
                     first  node, task three on the second node, and task four on the third node.  Block distribution is the default behavior if the number of tasks
                     exceeds the number of allocated nodes.

              cyclic The cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that consecutive  tasks  are  distributed  over  consecutive  nodes  (in  a
                     round-robin  fashion). For example, consider an allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A four-task cyclic distribution request will dis-
                     tribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and four on the first node, task two on the second node, and task  three  on  the  third  node.
                     Note  that when SelectType is select/cons_res, the same number of CPUs may not be allocated on each node. Task distribution will be round-robin
                     among all the nodes with CPUs yet to be assigned to tasks.  Cyclic distribution is the default behavior if the number of  tasks  is  no  larger
                     than the number of allocated nodes.

              plane  The tasks are distributed in blocks of size <size>. The size must be given or SLURM_DIST_PLANESIZE must be set. The number of tasks distributed
                     to each node is the same as for cyclic distribution, but the taskids assigned to each node depend on the plane  size.  Additional  distribution
                     specifications   cannot   be   combined   with   this   option.    For   more   details   (including   examples   and   diagrams),  please  see
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html and https://slurm.schedmd.com/dist_plane.html

              arbitrary
                     The arbitrary method of distribution will allocate processes in-order as listed in file designated by the environment variable  SLURM_HOSTFILE.
                     If  this  variable  is  listed it will over ride any other method specified.  If not set the method will default to block.  Inside the hostfile
                     must contain at minimum the number of hosts requested and be one per line or comma separated.  If specifying a task count  (-n,  --ntasks=<num-
                     ber>), your tasks will be laid out on the nodes in the order of the file.
                     NOTE:  The  arbitrary distribution option on a job allocation only controls the nodes to be allocated to the job and not the allocation of CPUs
                     on those nodes. This option is meant primarily to control a job step's task layout in an existing job allocation for the srun command.
                     NOTE: If the number of tasks is given and a list of requested nodes is also given, the number of nodes used from that list will be  reduced  to
                     match that of the number of tasks if the number of nodes in the list is greater than the number of tasks.

              Second distribution method (distribution of CPUs across sockets for binding):

              *      Use the default method for distributing CPUs across sockets (cyclic).

              block  The  block  distribution  method  will distribute allocated CPUs consecutively from the same socket for binding to tasks, before using the next
                     consecutive socket.

              cyclic The cyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to a given task consecutively from the same socket, and from the next
                     consecutive  socket  for the next task, in a round-robin fashion across sockets.  Tasks requiring more than one CPU will have all of those CPUs
                     allocated on a single socket if possible.

              fcyclic
                     The fcyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to tasks from consecutive sockets in a  round-robin  fashion  across
                     the sockets.  Tasks requiring more than one CPU will have each CPUs allocated in a cyclic fashion across sockets.

              Third distribution method (distribution of CPUs across cores for binding):

              *      Use the default method for distributing CPUs across cores (inherited from second distribution method).

              block  The  block distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs consecutively from the same core for binding to tasks, before using the next con-
                     secutive core.

              cyclic The cyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to a given task consecutively from the same core, and from  the  next
                     consecutive core for the next task, in a round-robin fashion across cores.

              fcyclic
                     The  fcyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to tasks from consecutive cores in a round-robin fashion across the
                     cores.

              Optional control for task distribution over nodes:

              Pack   Rather than evenly distributing a job step's tasks evenly across its allocated nodes, pack them as tightly as possible on the nodes.  This only
                     applies when the "block" task distribution method is used.

              NoPack Rather  than  packing  a job step's tasks as tightly as possible on the nodes, distribute them evenly.  This user option will supersede the Se-
                     lectTypeParameters CR_Pack_Nodes configuration parameter.

       -e, --error=<filename_pattern>
              Instruct Slurm to connect the batch script's standard error directly to the file name specified in the "filename pattern".  By default  both  standard
              output  and  standard error are directed to the same file.  For job arrays, the default file name is "slurm-%A_%a.out", "%A" is replaced by the job ID
              and "%a" with the array index.  For other jobs, the default file name is "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced by the job ID.  See  the  filename
              pattern section below for filename specification options.

       -x, --exclude=<node_name_list>
              Explicitly exclude certain nodes from the resources granted to the job.

       --exclusive[={user|mcs}]
              The  job  allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs (or just other users with the "=user" option or with the "=mcs" option).  If user/mcs
              are not specified (i.e. the job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs), the job is allocated all CPUs and GRES on all  nodes  in  the
              allocation, but is only allocated as much memory as it requested. This is by design to support gang scheduling, because suspended jobs still reside in
              memory. To request all the memory on a node, use --mem=0.  The default shared/exclusive behavior depends on system configuration and  the  partition's
              OverSubscribe  option  takes  precedence  over the job's option.  NOTE: Since shared GRES (MPS) cannot be allocated at the same time as a sharing GRES
              (GPU) this option only allocates all sharing GRES and no underlying shared GRES.

              NOTE: This option is mutually exclusive with --oversubscribe.

       --export={[ALL,]<environment_variables>|ALL|NONE}
              Identify which environment variables from the submission environment are propagated to the launched application. Note that SLURM_* variables  are  al-
              ways propagated.

              --export=ALL
                        Default  mode  if  --export  is  not specified. All of the user's environment will be loaded (either from the caller's environment or from a
                        clean environment if --get-user-env is specified).

              --export=NONE
                        Only SLURM_* variables from the user environment will be defined. User must use absolute path to the binary to be executed that will  define
                        the environment.  User can not specify explicit environment variables with "NONE".  --get-user-env will be ignored.

                        This  option  is  particularly  important for jobs that are submitted on one cluster and execute on a different cluster (e.g. with different
                        paths).  To avoid steps inheriting environment export settings (e.g. "NONE") from sbatch command, the environment variable  SLURM_EXPORT_ENV
                        should be set to "ALL" in the job script.

              --export=[ALL,]<environment_variables>
                        Exports all SLURM_* environment variables along with explicitly defined variables. Multiple environment variable names should be comma sepa-
                        rated.  Environment variable names may be specified to propagate the current value (e.g. "--export=EDITOR") or specific values  may  be  ex-
                        ported  (e.g.  "--export=EDITOR=/bin/emacs"). If "ALL" is specified, then all user environment variables will be loaded and will take prece-
                        dence over any explicitly given environment variables.

                   Example: --export=EDITOR,ARG1=test
                        In this example, the propagated environment will only contain the variable EDITOR from the user's  environment,  SLURM_*  environment  vari-
                        ables, and ARG1=test.

                   Example: --export=ALL,EDITOR=/bin/emacs
                        There are two possible outcomes for this example. If the caller has the EDITOR environment variable defined, then the job's environment will
                        inherit the variable from the caller's environment.  If the caller doesn't have an environment variable defined for EDITOR, then  the  job's
                        environment will use the value given by --export.

       --export-file={<filename>|<fd>}
              If  a  number between 3 and OPEN_MAX is specified as the argument to this option, a readable file descriptor will be assumed (STDIN and STDOUT are not
              supported as valid arguments).  Otherwise a filename is assumed.  Export environment variables defined in <filename> or read from <fd>  to  the  job's
              execution  environment.  The content is one or more environment variable definitions of the form NAME=value, each separated by a null character.  This
              allows the use of special characters in environment definitions.

       --extra=<string>
              An arbitrary string enclosed in double quotes if using spaces or some special characters.

       -B, --extra-node-info=<sockets>[:cores[:threads]]
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of sockets, cores per socket and/or threads per core.
              NOTE: These options do not specify the resource allocation size.  Each value specified is considered a minimum.  An asterisk (*)  can  be  used  as  a
              placeholder  indicating  that  all available resources of that type are to be utilized. Values can also be specified as min-max. The individual levels
              can also be specified in separate options if desired:
                  --sockets-per-node=<sockets>
                  --cores-per-socket=<cores>
                  --threads-per-core=<threads>
              If task/affinity plugin is enabled, then specifying an allocation in this manner also results in subsequently launched tasks being bound to threads if
              the  -B  option specifies a thread count, otherwise an option of cores if a core count is specified, otherwise an option of sockets.  If SelectType is
              configured to select/cons_res, it must have a parameter of CR_Core, CR_Core_Memory, CR_Socket, or CR_Socket_Memory for this option to be honored.   If
              not specified, the scontrol show job will display 'ReqS:C:T=*:*:*'. This option applies to job allocations.
              NOTE: This option is mutually exclusive with --hint, --threads-per-core and --ntasks-per-core.
              NOTE: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if -n was not specified) as one task per requested thread.

       --get-user-env[=timeout][mode]
              This  option  will  tell sbatch to retrieve the login environment variables for the user specified in the --uid option.  The environment variables are
              retrieved by running something of this sort "su - <username> -c /usr/bin/env" and parsing the output.  Be aware that any environment variables already
              set  in  sbatch's environment will take precedence over any environment variables in the user's login environment. Clear any environment variables be-
              fore calling sbatch that you do not want propagated to the spawned program.  The optional timeout value is in seconds. Default  value  is  8  seconds.
              The  optional mode value control the "su" options.  With a mode value of "S", "su" is executed without the "-" option.  With a mode value of "L", "su"
              is executed with the "-" option, replicating the login environment.  If mode not specified, the mode established at Slurm build time is used.  Example
              of use include "--get-user-env", "--get-user-env=10" "--get-user-env=10L", and "--get-user-env=S".

       --gid=<group>
              If  sbatch is run as root, and the --gid option is used, submit the job with group's group access permissions.  group may be the group name or the nu-
              merical group ID.

       --gpu-bind=[verbose,]<type>
              Bind tasks to specific GPUs.  By default every spawned task can access every GPU allocated to the step.  If "verbose,"  is  specified  before  <type>,
              then print out GPU binding debug information to the stderr of the tasks. GPU binding is ignored if there is only one task.

              Supported type options:

              closest   Bind  each task to the GPU(s) which are closest.  In a NUMA environment, each task may be bound to more than one GPU (i.e.  all GPUs in that
                        NUMA environment).

              map_gpu:<list>
                        Bind by setting GPU masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <gpu_id_for_task_0>,<gpu_id_for_task_1>,... GPU  IDs  are  inter-
                        preted as decimal values unless they are preceded with '0x' in which case they interpreted as hexadecimal values. If the number of tasks (or
                        ranks) exceeds the number of elements in this list, elements in the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning of  the  list.
                        To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with an asterisk and repetition count.  For example "map_gpu:0*4,1*4".
                        If the task/cgroup plugin is used and ConstrainDevices is set in cgroup.conf, then the GPU IDs are zero-based indexes relative to  the  GPUs
                        allocated to the job (e.g. the first GPU is 0, even if the global ID is 3). Otherwise, the GPU IDs are global IDs, and all GPUs on each node
                        in the job should be allocated for predictable binding results.

              mask_gpu:<list>
                        Bind by setting GPU masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <gpu_mask_for_task_0>,<gpu_mask_for_task_1>,...  The  mapping  is
                        specified  for  a  node  and  identical mapping is applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to the
                        first mask specified in the list, etc.). GPU masks are always interpreted as hexadecimal values but can be preceded with an  optional  '0x'.
                        To  simplify  support  for  large  task  counts,  the  lists  may  follow  a  map  with  an  asterisk  and  repetition  count.   For example
                        "mask_gpu:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".  If the task/cgroup plugin is used and ConstrainDevices is set in cgroup.conf, then the GPU IDs are zero-based in-
                        dexes  relative  to  the  GPUs allocated to the job (e.g. the first GPU is 0, even if the global ID is 3). Otherwise, the GPU IDs are global
                        IDs, and all GPUs on each node in the job should be allocated for predictable binding results.

              none      Do not bind tasks to GPUs (turns off binding if --gpus-per-task is requested).

              per_task:<gpus_per_task>
                        Each task will be bound to the number of gpus specified in <gpus_per_task>. Gpus are assigned in order to tasks. The first task will be  as-
                        signed the first x number of gpus on the node etc.

              single:<tasks_per_gpu>
                        Like  --gpu-bind=closest,  except  that  each  task  can  only be bound to a single GPU, even when it can be bound to multiple GPUs that are
                        equally close.  The GPU to bind to is determined by <tasks_per_gpu>, where the first <tasks_per_gpu> tasks are bound to the first GPU avail-
                        able,  the  second  <tasks_per_gpu>  tasks are bound to the second GPU available, etc.  This is basically a block distribution of tasks onto
                        available GPUs, where the available GPUs are determined by the socket affinity of the task and the socket affinity of the GPUs as  specified
                        in gres.conf's Cores parameter.

       --gpu-freq=[<type]=value>[,<type=value>][,verbose]
              Request  that GPUs allocated to the job are configured with specific frequency values.  This option can be used to independently configure the GPU and
              its memory frequencies.  After the job is completed, the frequencies of all affected GPUs will be reset to  the  highest  possible  values.   In  some
              cases,  system power caps may override the requested values.  The field type can be "memory".  If type is not specified, the GPU frequency is implied.
              The value field can either be "low", "medium", "high", "highm1" or a numeric value in megahertz (MHz).  If the specified numeric value is  not  possi-
              ble,  a  value as close as possible will be used. See below for definition of the values.  The verbose option causes current GPU frequency information
              to be logged.  Examples of use include "--gpu-freq=medium,memory=high" and "--gpu-freq=450".

              Supported value definitions:

              low       the lowest available frequency.

              medium    attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range.

              high      the highest available frequency.

              highm1    (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency.

       -G, --gpus=[type:]<number>
              Specify the total number of GPUs required for the job.  An optional GPU type specification can be supplied.  For example "--gpus=volta:3".   See  also
              the --gpus-per-node, --gpus-per-socket and --gpus-per-task options.
              NOTE: The allocation has to contain at least one GPU per node.

       --gpus-per-node=[type:]<number>
              Specify  the  number  of  GPUs required for the job on each node included in the job's resource allocation.  An optional GPU type specification can be
              supplied.   For  example  "--gpus-per-node=volta:3".   Multiple   options   can   be   requested   in   a   comma   separated   list,   for   example:
              "--gpus-per-node=volta:3,kepler:1".  See also the --gpus, --gpus-per-socket and --gpus-per-task options.

       --gpus-per-socket=[type:]<number>
              Specify  the  number of GPUs required for the job on each socket included in the job's resource allocation.  An optional GPU type specification can be
              supplied.   For  example  "--gpus-per-socket=volta:3".   Multiple  options  can   be   requested   in   a   comma   separated   list,   for   example:
              "--gpus-per-socket=volta:3,kepler:1".   Requires  job to specify a sockets per node count ( --sockets-per-node).  See also the --gpus, --gpus-per-node
              and --gpus-per-task options.

       --gpus-per-task=[type:]<number>
              Specify the number of GPUs required for the job on each task to be spawned in the job's resource allocation.  An optional GPU type  specification  can
              be   supplied.    For   example   "--gpus-per-task=volta:1".   Multiple   options   can   be  requested  in  a  comma  separated  list,  for  example:
              "--gpus-per-task=volta:3,kepler:1". See also the --gpus, --gpus-per-socket and --gpus-per-node options.  This option requires an explicit task  count,
              e.g.  -n,  --ntasks  or  "--gpus=X  --gpus-per-task=Y"  rather  than  an  ambiguous  range of nodes with -N, --nodes.  This option will implicitly set
              --gpu-bind=per_task:<gpus_per_task>, but that can be overridden with an explicit --gpu-bind specification.

       --gres=<list>
              Specifies a comma-delimited list of generic consumable resources.  The format for each entry in the list is "name[[:type]:count]".  The  name  is  the
              type  of  consumable  resource (e.g. gpu).  The type is an optional classification for the resource (e.g. a100).  The count is the number of those re-
              sources with a default value of 1.  The count can have a suffix of "k" or "K" (multiple of 1024), "m" or "M" (multiple of 1024 x  1024),  "g"  or  "G"
              (multiple  of 1024 x 1024 x 1024), "t" or "T" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024), "p" or "P" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024).  The
              specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node.  The available generic consumable resources is configurable by the  system  administra-
              tor.   A  list  of available generic consumable resources will be printed and the command will exit if the option argument is "help".  Examples of use
              include "--gres=gpu:2", "--gres=gpu:kepler:2", and "--gres=help".

       --gres-flags=<type>
              Specify generic resource task binding options.

              disable-binding
                     Disable filtering of CPUs with respect to generic resource locality.  This option is currently required to use more CPUs than are  bound  to  a
                     GRES  (i.e.  if  a GPU is bound to the CPUs on one socket, but resources on more than one socket are required to run the job).  This option may
                     permit a job to be allocated resources sooner than otherwise possible, but may result in lower job performance.
                     NOTE: This option is specific to SelectType=cons_res.

              enforce-binding
                     The only CPUs available to the job will be those bound to the selected GRES (i.e. the CPUs identified in the gres.conf file  will  be  strictly
                     enforced).  This option may result in delayed initiation of a job.  For example a job requiring two GPUs and one CPU will be delayed until both
                     GPUs on a single socket are available rather than using GPUs bound to separate sockets, however, the application performance  may  be  improved
                     due  to improved communication speed.  Requires the node to be configured with more than one socket and resource filtering will be performed on
                     a per-socket basis.
                     NOTE: This option is specific to SelectType=cons_tres.

       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

       --hint=<type>
              Bind tasks according to application hints.
              NOTE: This option cannot be used in conjunction with --ntasks-per-core, --threads-per-core or -B. If --hint is specified as a command  line  argument,
              it will take precedence over the environment.

              compute_bound
                     Select settings for compute bound applications: use all cores in each socket, one thread per core.

              memory_bound
                     Select settings for memory bound applications: use only one core in each socket, one thread per core.

              [no]multithread
                     [don't]  use  extra  threads  with  in-core  multi-threading  which  can benefit communication intensive applications.  Only supported with the
                     task/affinity plugin.

              help   show this help message

       -H, --hold
              Specify the job is to be submitted in a held state (priority of zero).  A held job can now be released using scontrol  to  reset  its  priority  (e.g.
              "scontrol release <job_id>").

       --ignore-pbs
              Ignore all "#PBS" and "#BSUB" options specified in the batch script.

       -i, --input=<filename_pattern>
              Instruct Slurm to connect the batch script's standard input directly to the file name specified in the "filename pattern".

              By  default,  "/dev/null"  is open on the batch script's standard input and both standard output and standard error are directed to a file of the name
              "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced with the job allocation number, as described below in the filename pattern section.

       -J, --job-name=<jobname>
              Specify a name for the job allocation. The specified name will appear along with the job id number when querying running jobs on the system.  The  de-
              fault is the name of the batch script, or just "sbatch" if the script is read on sbatch's standard input.

       --kill-on-invalid-dep=<yes|no>
              If  a  job  has  an invalid dependency and it can never run this parameter tells Slurm to terminate it or not. A terminated job state will be JOB_CAN-
              CELLED.  If this option is not specified the system wide behavior applies.  By default the job stays pending with reason  DependencyNeverSatisfied  or
              if the kill_invalid_depend is specified in slurm.conf the job is terminated.

       -L, --licenses=<license>[@db][:count][,license[@db][:count]...]
              Specification  of  licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which must be allocated to this job.  License names can be fol-
              lowed by a colon and count (the default count is one).  Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g.   "--licenses=foo:4,bar").   To  submit
              jobs using remote licenses, those served by the slurmdbd, specify the name of the server providing the licenses.  For example "--license=nastran@slur-
              mdb:12".

              NOTE: When submitting heterogeneous jobs, license requests may only be made on the first component job.  For example "sbatch -L ansys:2 : script.sh".

       --mail-type=<type>
              Notify user by email when certain event types occur.  Valid type values are NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, ALL (equivalent to BEGIN, END, FAIL,  IN-
              VALID_DEPEND,  REQUEUE,  and  STAGE_OUT),  INVALID_DEPEND  (dependency  never  satisfied),  STAGE_OUT (burst buffer stage out and teardown completed),
              TIME_LIMIT, TIME_LIMIT_90 (reached 90 percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_80 (reached 80 percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_50 (reached 50  percent  of
              time limit) and ARRAY_TASKS (send emails for each array task).  Multiple type values may be specified in a comma separated list.  The user to be noti-
              fied is indicated with --mail-user.  Unless the ARRAY_TASKS option is specified, mail notifications on job BEGIN, END and FAIL apply to a job array as
              a whole rather than generating individual email messages for each task in the job array.

       --mail-user=<user>
              User to receive email notification of state changes as defined by --mail-type.  The default value is the submitting user.

       --mcs-label=<mcs>
              Used  only  when  the mcs/group plugin is enabled.  This parameter is a group among the groups of the user.  Default value is calculated by the Plugin
              mcs if it's enabled.

       --mem=<size>[units]
              Specify the real memory required per node.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].  Default  value
              is  DefMemPerNode and the maximum value is MaxMemPerNode. If configured, both parameters can be seen using the scontrol show config command.  This pa-
              rameter would generally be used if whole nodes are allocated to jobs (SelectType=select/linear).   Also  see  --mem-per-cpu  and  --mem-per-gpu.   The
              --mem,  --mem-per-cpu  and  --mem-per-gpu options are mutually exclusive. If --mem, --mem-per-cpu or --mem-per-gpu are specified as command line argu-
              ments, then they will take precedence over the environment.

              NOTE: A memory size specification of zero is treated as a special case and grants the job access to all of the memory on each node.

              NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently relies upon the task/cgroup plugin or enabling of accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic  ba-
              sis  (data need not be stored, just collected). In both cases memory use is based upon the job's Resident Set Size (RSS). A task may exceed the memory
              limit until the next periodic accounting sample.

       --mem-bind=[{quiet|verbose},]<type>
              Bind tasks to memory. Used only when the task/affinity plugin is enabled and the NUMA memory functions are available.  Note that the resolution of CPU
              and memory binding may differ on some architectures. For example, CPU binding may be performed at the level of the cores within a processor while mem-
              ory binding will be performed at the level of nodes, where the definition of "nodes" may differ from system to system.  By default no  memory  binding
              is  performed; any task using any CPU can use any memory. This option is typically used to ensure that each task is bound to the memory closest to its
              assigned CPU. The use of any type other than "none" or "local" is not recommended.

              NOTE: To have Slurm always report on the selected memory binding for all commands executed in a shell, you can enable  verbose  mode  by  setting  the
              SLURM_MEM_BIND environment variable value to "verbose".

              The following informational environment variables are set when --mem-bind is in use:

                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_LIST
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_PREFER
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_SORT
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_TYPE
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_VERBOSE

              See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for a more detailed description of the individual SLURM_MEM_BIND* variables.

              Supported options include:

              local  Use memory local to the processor in use

              map_mem:<list>
                     Bind  by  setting  memory  masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <numa_id_for_task_0>,<numa_id_for_task_1>,...  The mapping is
                     specified for a node and identical mapping is applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to  the  first
                     ID  specified in the list, etc.).  NUMA IDs are interpreted as decimal values unless they are preceded with '0x' in which case they interpreted
                     as hexadecimal values.  If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of elements in this list, elements in the list will be  reused  as
                     needed  starting  from  the  beginning of the list.  To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with an asterisk and
                     repetition count.  For example "map_mem:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".  For predictable binding results, all CPUs for each node in the job should be allocated
                     to the job.

              mask_mem:<list>
                     Bind by setting memory masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <numa_mask_for_task_0>,<numa_mask_for_task_1>,...  The mapping is
                     specified for a node and identical mapping is applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to  the  first
                     mask  specified  in the list, etc.).  NUMA masks are always interpreted as hexadecimal values.  Note that masks must be preceded with a '0x' if
                     they don't begin with [0-9] so they are seen as numerical values.  If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number  of  elements  in  this
                     list,  elements  in  the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning of the list.  To simplify support for large task counts, the
                     lists may follow a mask with an asterisk and repetition count.  For example "mask_mem:0*4,1*4".  For predictable binding results, all CPUs  for
                     each node in the job should be allocated to the job.

       --mem-per-cpu=<size>[units]
              Minimum memory required per usable allocated CPU.  Default units are megabytes.  The default value is DefMemPerCPU and the maximum value is MaxMemPer-
              CPU (see exception below). If configured, both parameters can be seen using the scontrol show config command.  Note that if  the  job's  --mem-per-cpu
              value  exceeds the configured MaxMemPerCPU, then the user's limit will be treated as a memory limit per task; --mem-per-cpu will be reduced to a value
              no larger than MaxMemPerCPU; --cpus-per-task will be set and the value of --cpus-per-task multiplied by the new --mem-per-cpu  value  will  equal  the
              original  --mem-per-cpu  value  specified by the user.  This parameter would generally be used if individual processors are allocated to jobs (Select-
              Type=select/cons_res).  If resources are allocated by core, socket, or whole nodes, then the number of CPUs allocated to a job may be higher than  the
              task  count  and  the  value  of  --mem-per-cpu  should  be  adjusted  accordingly.   Also  see --mem and --mem-per-gpu.  The --mem, --mem-per-cpu and
              --mem-per-gpu options are mutually exclusive.

              NOTE: If the final amount of memory requested by a job can't be satisfied by any of the nodes configured in the partition, the job will  be  rejected.
              This  could  happen  if --mem-per-cpu is used with the --exclusive option for a job allocation and --mem-per-cpu times the number of CPUs on a node is
              greater than the total memory of that node.

              NOTE: This applies to usable allocated CPUs in a job allocation.  This is important when more than one thread per core is configured.  If  a  job  re-
              quests  --threads-per-core  with  fewer threads on a core than exist on the core (or --hint=nomultithread which implies --threads-per-core=1), the job
              will be unable to use those extra threads on the core and those threads will not be included in the memory per CPU calculation. But if the job has ac-
              cess  to  all  threads  on the core, those threads will be included in the memory per CPU calculation even if the job did not explicitly request those
              threads.

              In the following examples, each core has two threads.

              In this first example, two tasks can run on separate hyperthreads in the same core because --threads-per-core is not used. The third  task  uses  both
              threads of the second core. The allocated memory per cpu includes all threads:

              $ salloc -n3 --mem-per-cpu=100
              salloc: Granted job allocation 17199
              $ sacct -j $SLURM_JOB_ID -X -o jobid%7,reqtres%35,alloctres%35
                JobID                             ReqTRES                           AllocTRES
              ------- ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
                17199     billing=3,cpu=3,mem=300M,node=1     billing=4,cpu=4,mem=400M,node=1

              In  this second example, because of --threads-per-core=1, each task is allocated an entire core but is only able to use one thread per core. Allocated
              CPUs includes all threads on each core. However, allocated memory per cpu includes only the usable thread in each core.

              $ salloc -n3 --mem-per-cpu=100 --threads-per-core=1
              salloc: Granted job allocation 17200

       --mem-per-gpu=<size>[units]
              Minimum memory required per allocated GPU.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].  Default  value
              is  DefMemPerGPU  and is available on both a global and per partition basis.  If configured, the parameters can be seen using the scontrol show config
              and scontrol show partition commands.  Also see --mem.  The --mem, --mem-per-cpu and --mem-per-gpu options are mutually exclusive.

       --mincpus=<n>
              Specify a minimum number of logical cpus/processors per node.

       --network=<type>
              Specify information pertaining to the switch or network.  The interpretation of type is system dependent.  This option is supported when running Slurm
              on  a  Cray natively.  It is used to request using Network Performance Counters.  Only one value per request is valid.  All options are case in-sensi-
              tive.  In this configuration supported values include:

              system
                    Use the system-wide network performance counters. Only nodes requested will be marked in use for the job allocation.  If the job does  not  fill
                    up  the entire system the rest of the nodes are not able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if idle their state will appear as PerfCnts.  These
                    nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.

              blade Use the blade network performance counters. Only nodes requested will be marked in use for the job allocation.  If the job does not fill up  the
                    entire  blade(s)  allocated to the job those blade(s) are not able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if idle their state will appear as PerfC-
                    nts.  These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.

              In all cases the job allocation request must specify the --exclusive option.  Otherwise the request will be denied.

              Also with any of these options steps are not allowed to share blades, so resources would remain idle inside an allocation if the  step  running  on  a
              blade does not take up all the nodes on the blade.

              The network option is also available on systems with HPE Slingshot networks. It can be used to request a job VNI (to be used for communication between
              job steps in a job). It also can be used to override the default network resources allocated for the job step. Multiple values may be specified  in  a
              comma-separated list.

              tcs=<class1>[:<class2>]...
                    Set of traffic classes to configure for applications.  Supported traffic classes are DEDICATED_ACCESS, LOW_LATENCY, BULK_DATA, and BEST_EFFORT.

              no_vni
                    Don't allocate any VNIs for this job (even if multi-node).

              job_vni
                    Allocate a job VNI for this job.

              single_node_vni
                    Allocate a job VNI for this job, even if it is a single-node job.

              adjust_limits
                    If  set, slurmd will set an upper bound on network resource reservations by taking the per-NIC maximum resource quantity and subtracting the re-
                    served or used values (whichever is higher) for any system network services; this is the default.

              no_adjust_limits
                    If set, slurmd will calculate network resource reservations based only upon the per-resource configuration default and number of  tasks  in  the
                    application;  it  will not set an upper bound on those reservation requests based on resource usage of already-existing system network services.
                    Setting this will mean more application launches could fail based on network resource exhaustion, but if the application absolutely needs a cer-
                    tain amount of resources to function, this option will ensure that.

              def_<rsrc>=<val>
                    Per-CPU reserved allocation for this resource.

              res_<rsrc>=<val>
                    Per-node reserved allocation for this resource.  If set, overrides the per-CPU allocation.

              max_<rsrc>=<val>
                    Maximum per-node limit for this resource.

              depth=<depth>
                    Multiplier for per-CPU resource allocation.  Default is the number of reserved CPUs on the node.

              The resources that may be requested are:

              txqs  Transmit command queues. The default is 2 per-CPU, maximum 1024 per-node.

              tgqs  Target command queues. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 512 per-node.

              eqs   Event queues. The default is 2 per-CPU, maximum 2047 per-node.

              cts   Counters. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 2047 per-node.

              tles  Trigger list entries. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 2048 per-node.

              ptes  Portable table entries. The default is 6 per-CPU, maximum 2048 per-node.

              les   List entries. The default is 16 per-CPU, maximum 16384 per-node.

              acs   Addressing contexts. The default is 4 per-CPU, maximum 1022 per-node.

       --nice[=adjustment]
              Run  the  job with an adjusted scheduling priority within Slurm. With no adjustment value the scheduling priority is decreased by 100. A negative nice
              value increases the priority, otherwise decreases it. The adjustment range is +/- 2147483645. Only privileged users can specify a negative adjustment.

       -k, --no-kill[=off]
              Do not automatically terminate a job if one of the nodes it has been allocated fails.  The user will assume the responsibilities  for  fault-tolerance
              should a node fail.  The job allocation will not be revoked so the user may launch new job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.  This op-
              tion does not set the SLURM_NO_KILL environment variable.  Therefore, when a node fails, steps  running  on  that  node  will  be  killed  unless  the
              SLURM_NO_KILL environment variable was explicitly set or srun calls within the job allocation explicitly requested --no-kill.

              Specify an optional argument of "off" to disable the effect of the SBATCH_NO_KILL environment variable.

              By default Slurm terminates the entire job allocation if any node fails in its range of allocated nodes.

       --no-requeue
              Specifies  that  the batch job should never be requeued under any circumstances (see note below).  Setting this option will prevent system administra-
              tors from being able to restart the job (for example, after a scheduled downtime), recover from a node failure, or be requeued upon  preemption  by  a
              higher  priority  job.  When a job is requeued, the batch script is initiated from its beginning.  Also see the --requeue option.  The JobRequeue con-
              figuration parameter controls the default behavior on the cluster.

              NOTE: ForceRequeueOnFail if set as an option to the PrologFlags parameter in slurm.conf can override this setting.

       -F, --nodefile=<node_file>
              Much like --nodelist, but the list is contained in a file of name node file.  The node names of the list may also span multiple  lines  in  the  file.
              Duplicate node names in the file will be ignored.  The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names will be sorted by Slurm.

       -w, --nodelist=<node_name_list>
              Request  a  specific list of hosts.  The job will contain all of these hosts and possibly additional hosts as needed to satisfy resource requirements.
              The list may be specified as a comma-separated list of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1-5,7,...] for example), or a filename.  The host  list  will  be
              assumed  to  be  a filename if it contains a "/" character.  If you specify a minimum node or processor count larger than can be satisfied by the sup-
              plied host list, additional resources will be allocated on other nodes as needed.  Duplicate node names in the list will be ignored.  The order of the
              node names in the list is not important; the node names will be sorted by Slurm.

       -N, --nodes=<minnodes>[-maxnodes]|<size_string>
              Request  that  a minimum of minnodes nodes be allocated to this job.  A maximum node count may also be specified with maxnodes.  If only one number is
              specified, this is used as both the minimum and maximum node count. Node count can be also specified as size_string.   The  size_string  specification
              identifies what nodes values should be used.  Multiple values may be specified using a comma separated list or with a step function by suffix contain-
              ing a colon and number values with a "-" separator.  For example, "--nodes=1-15:4" is equivalent to "--nodes=1,5,9,13".  The partition's  node  limits
              supersede those of the job.  If a job's node limits are outside of the range permitted for its associated partition, the job will be left in a PENDING
              state.  This permits possible execution at a later time, when the partition limit is changed.  If a job node limit exceeds the number of nodes config-
              ured  in  the  partition, the job will be rejected.  Note that the environment variable SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES will be set to the count of nodes actually
              allocated to the job. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  section for more information.  If -N is not specified, the default behavior is to allocate enough
              nodes  to  satisfy  the  requested resources as expressed by per-job specification options, e.g. -n, -c and --gpus.  The job will be allocated as many
              nodes as possible within the range specified and without delaying the initiation of the job.  The node count specification may include a numeric value
              followed by a suffix of "k" (multiplies numeric value by 1,024) or "m" (multiplies numeric value by 1,048,576).

       -n, --ntasks=<number>
              sbatch  does  not  launch  tasks, it requests an allocation of resources and submits a batch script. This option advises the Slurm controller that job
              steps run within the allocation will launch a maximum of number tasks and to provide for sufficient resources.  The default is one task per node,  but
              note that the --cpus-per-task option will change this default.

       --ntasks-per-core=<ntasks>
              Request the maximum ntasks be invoked on each core.  Meant to be used with the --ntasks option.  Related to --ntasks-per-node except at the core level
              instead of the node level. This option will be inherited by srun.
              NOTE: This option is not supported when using SelectType=select/linear. This value can not be greater than --threads-per-core.

       --ntasks-per-gpu=<ntasks>
              Request that there are ntasks tasks invoked for every GPU.  This option can work in two ways: 1) either specify --ntasks in addition, in which case  a
              type-less  GPU  specification  will be automatically determined to satisfy --ntasks-per-gpu, or 2) specify the GPUs wanted (e.g. via --gpus or --gres)
              without specifying --ntasks, and the total task count will be automatically determined.  The number of CPUs needed will be automatically increased  if
              necessary  to allow for any calculated task count.  This option will implicitly set --gpu-bind=single:<ntasks>, but that can be overridden with an ex-
              plicit --gpu-bind specification.  This option is not compatible with a node range (i.e. -N<minnodes-maxnodes>).  This option is  not  compatible  with
              --gpus-per-task,  --gpus-per-socket, or --ntasks-per-node.  This option is not supported unless SelectType=cons_tres is configured (either directly or
              indirectly on Cray systems).

       --ntasks-per-node=<ntasks>
              Request that ntasks be invoked on each node.  If used with the --ntasks option, the --ntasks option will take  precedence  and  the  --ntasks-per-node
              will  be  treated as a maximum count of tasks per node.  Meant to be used with the --nodes option.  This is related to --cpus-per-task=ncpus, but does
              not require knowledge of the actual number of cpus on each node.  In some cases, it is more convenient to be able to request that no more than a  spe-
              cific  number  of tasks be invoked on each node.  Examples of this include submitting a hybrid MPI/OpenMP app where only one MPI "task/rank" should be
              assigned to each node while allowing  the  OpenMP  portion  to  utilize  all  of  the  parallelism  present  in  the  node,  or  submitting  a  single
              setup/cleanup/monitoring job to each node of a pre-existing allocation as one step in a larger job script.

       --ntasks-per-socket=<ntasks>
              Request  the  maximum ntasks be invoked on each socket.  Meant to be used with the --ntasks option.  Related to --ntasks-per-node except at the socket
              level instead of the node level.  NOTE: This option is not supported when using SelectType=select/linear.

       --open-mode={append|truncate}
              Open the output and error files using append or truncate mode as specified.  The default value is specified by the system configuration parameter Job-
              FileAppend.

       -o, --output=<filename_pattern>
              Instruct  Slurm to connect the batch script's standard output directly to the file name specified in the "filename pattern".  By default both standard
              output and standard error are directed to the same file.  For job arrays, the default file name is "slurm-%A_%a.out", "%A" is replaced by the  job  ID
              and  "%a"  with the array index.  For other jobs, the default file name is "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced by the job ID.  See the filename
              pattern section below for filename specification options.

       -O, --overcommit
              Overcommit resources.

              When applied to a job allocation (not including jobs requesting exclusive access to the nodes) the resources are allocated as if  only  one  task  per
              node  is requested. This means that the requested number of cpus per task (-c, --cpus-per-task) are allocated per node rather than being multiplied by
              the number of tasks. Options used to specify the number of tasks per node, socket, core, etc. are ignored.

              When applied to job step allocations (the srun command when executed within an existing job allocation), this option can be used to launch  more  than
              one  task  per CPU.  Normally, srun will not allocate more than one process per CPU.  By specifying --overcommit you are explicitly allowing more than
              one process per CPU. However no more than MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE tasks are permitted to execute per node.  NOTE: MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE is defined in the file
              slurm.h and is not a variable, it is set at Slurm build time.

       -s, --oversubscribe
              The job allocation can over-subscribe resources with other running jobs.  The resources to be over-subscribed can be nodes, sockets, cores, and/or hy-
              perthreads depending upon configuration.  The default over-subscribe behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's OverSubscribe option
              takes  precedence over the job's option.  This option may result in the allocation being granted sooner than if the --oversubscribe option was not set
              and allow higher system utilization, but application performance will likely suffer due to competition for resources.  Also see  the  --exclusive  op-
              tion.

              NOTE: This option is mutually exclusive with --exclusive.

       --parsable
              Outputs only the job id number and the cluster name if present.  The values are separated by a semicolon. Errors will still be displayed.

       -p, --partition=<partition_names>
              Request  a  specific partition for the resource allocation.  If not specified, the default behavior is to allow the slurm controller to select the de-
              fault partition as designated by the system administrator. If the job can use more than one partition, specify their names in a  comma  separate  list
              and the one offering earliest initiation will be used with no regard given to the partition name ordering (although higher priority partitions will be
              considered first).  When the job is initiated, the name of the partition used will be placed first in the job record partition string.

       --power=<flags>
              Comma separated list of power management plugin options.  Currently available flags include: level (all nodes allocated to the job should have identi-
              cal power caps, may be disabled by the Slurm configuration option PowerParameters=job_no_level).

       --prefer=<list>
              Nodes  can have features assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify which of these features are desired but not required by their
              job using the prefer option.  This option operates independently from --constraint and will override whatever is set there if possible.  When schedul-
              ing  the  features in --prefer are tried first if a node set isn't available with those features then --constraint is attempted.  See --constraint for
              more information, this option behaves the same way.

       --priority=<value>
              Request a specific job priority.  May be subject to configuration specific constraints.  value should either be a numeric value or "TOP" (for  highest
              possible value).  Only Slurm operators and administrators can set the priority of a job.

       --profile={all|none|<type>[,<type>...]}
              Enables  detailed  data collection by the acct_gather_profile plugin.  Detailed data are typically time-series that are stored in an HDF5 file for the
              job or an InfluxDB database depending on the configured plugin.

              All       All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

              None      No data types are collected. This is the default.
                         (Cannot be combined with other values.)

       Valid type values are:

              Energy Energy data is collected.

              Task   Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.

              Lustre Lustre data is collected.

              Network
                     Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.

       --propagate[=rlimit[,rlimit...]]
              Allows users to specify which of the modifiable (soft) resource limits to propagate to the compute nodes and apply to their  jobs.  If  no  rlimit  is
              specified, then all resource limits will be propagated.  The following rlimit names are supported by Slurm (although some options may not be supported
              on some systems):

              ALL       All limits listed below (default)

              NONE      No limits listed below

              AS        The maximum address space (virtual memory) for a process.

              CORE      The maximum size of core file

              CPU       The maximum amount of CPU time

              DATA      The maximum size of a process's data segment

              FSIZE     The maximum size of files created. Note that if the user sets FSIZE to less than the current size of the slurmd.log, job launches will  fail
                        with a 'File size limit exceeded' error.

              MEMLOCK   The maximum size that may be locked into memory

              NOFILE    The maximum number of open files

              NPROC     The maximum number of processes available

              RSS       The maximum resident set size. Note that this only has effect with Linux kernels 2.4.30 or older or BSD.

              STACK     The maximum stack size

       -q, --qos=<qos>
              Request  a  quality of service for the job.  QOS values can be defined for each user/cluster/account association in the Slurm database.  Users will be
              limited to their association's defined set of qos's when the Slurm configuration parameter, AccountingStorageEnforce, includes "qos"  in  its  defini-
              tion.

       -Q, --quiet
              Suppress informational messages from sbatch such as Job ID. Only errors will still be displayed.

       --reboot
              Force  the  allocated  nodes to reboot before starting the job.  This is only supported with some system configurations and will otherwise be silently
              ignored. Only root, SlurmUser or admins can reboot nodes.

       --requeue
              Specifies that the batch job should be eligible for requeuing.  The job may be requeued explicitly by a system administrator, after node  failure,  or
              upon  preemption  by  a higher priority job.  When a job is requeued, the batch script is initiated from its beginning.  Also see the --no-requeue op-
              tion.  The JobRequeue configuration parameter controls the default behavior on the cluster.

       --reservation=<reservation_names>
              Allocate resources for the job from the named reservation. If the job can use more than one reservation, specify their names in a comma separate  list
              and the one offering earliest initiation. Each reservation will be considered in the order it was requested.  All reservations will be listed in scon-
              trol/squeue through the life of the job.  In accounting the first reservation will be seen and after the job starts the reservation used will  replace
              it.

       --signal=[{R|B}:]<sig_num>[@sig_time]
              When  a  job is within sig_time seconds of its end time, send it the signal sig_num.  Due to the resolution of event handling by Slurm, the signal may
              be sent up to 60 seconds earlier than specified.  sig_num may either be a signal number or name (e.g. "10" or "USR1").  sig_time must have an  integer
              value between 0 and 65535.  By default, no signal is sent before the job's end time.  If a sig_num is specified without any sig_time, the default time
              will be 60 seconds.  Use the "B:" option to signal only the batch shell, none of the other processes will be signaled. By default all job  steps  will
              be signaled, but not the batch shell itself.  Use the "R:" option to allow this job to overlap with a reservation with MaxStartDelay set.  To have the
              signal sent at preemption time see the send_user_signal PreemptParameter.

       --sockets-per-node=<sockets>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of sockets.  See additional information under -B option above  when  task/affinity
              plugin is enabled.
              NOTE: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if -n was not specified) as one task per requested thread.

       --spread-job
              Spread  the job allocation over as many nodes as possible and attempt to evenly distribute tasks across the allocated nodes.  This option disables the
              topology/tree plugin.

       --switches=<count>[@max-time]
              When a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of leaf switches desired for the job allocation and optionally the maximum time  to  wait
              for  that  number of switches. If Slurm finds an allocation containing more switches than the count specified, the job remains pending until it either
              finds an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires.  It there is no switch count limit, there is no delay in  starting  the  job.
              Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:sec-
              onds".  The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system  administrator  using  the  SchedulerParameters  configuration  parameter  with  the
              max_switch_wait  parameter option.  On a dragonfly network the only switch count supported is 1 since communication performance will be highest when a
              job is allocate resources on one leaf switch or more than 2 leaf switches.  The default max-time is the max_switch_wait SchedulerParameters.

       --test-only
              Validate the batch script and return an estimate of when a job would be scheduled to run given the current job queue and all the other arguments spec-
              ifying the job requirements. No job is actually submitted.

       --thread-spec=<num>
              Count  of  specialized  threads per node reserved by the job for system operations and not used by the application. The application will not use these
              threads, but will be charged for their allocation.  This option can not be used with the --core-spec option.

              NOTE: Explicitly setting a job's specialized thread value implicitly sets its --exclusive option, reserving entire nodes for the job.

       --threads-per-core=<threads>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of threads per core. In task layout, use the specified maximum number  of  threads
              per  core.  NOTE: "Threads" refers to the number of processing units on each core rather than the number of application tasks to be launched per core.
              See additional information under -B option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.
              NOTE: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if -n was not specified) as one task per requested thread.

       -t, --time=<time>
              Set a limit on the total run time of the job allocation.  If the requested time limit exceeds the partition's time limit, the job will be  left  in  a
              PENDING  state  (possibly  indefinitely).  The default time limit is the partition's default time limit.  When the time limit is reached, each task in
              each job step is sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL.  The interval between signals is specified by the  Slurm  configuration  parameter  KillWait.   The
              OverTimeLimit configuration parameter may permit the job to run longer than scheduled.  Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up
              to the next minute.

              A time limit of zero requests that no time limit be imposed.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes",  "minutes:seconds",  "hours:minutes:seconds",
              "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".

       --time-min=<time>
              Set  a minimum time limit on the job allocation.  If specified, the job may have its --time limit lowered to a value no lower than --time-min if doing
              so permits the job to begin execution earlier than otherwise possible.  The job's time limit will not be changed after the job is allocated resources.
              This  is  performed by a backfill scheduling algorithm to allocate resources otherwise reserved for higher priority jobs.  Acceptable time formats in-
              clude "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".

       --tmp=<size>[units]
              Specify a minimum amount of temporary disk space per node.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].

       --tres-per-task=<list>
              Specifies a comma-delimited list of trackable resources required for the job on each task to be spawned in the job's resource allocation.  The  format
              for  each  entry in the list is "trestype:[tresname:]count".  The trestype is the type of trackable resource requested (e.g. cpu, gres, license, etc).
              The tresname is the name of the trackable resource, as can be seen with sacctmgr show tres. This is required when it exists for  tres  types  such  as
              gres, license, etc. (e.g. gpu, gpu:a100).  The count is the number of those resources.
              The count can have a suffix of
              "k" or "K" (multiple of 1024),
              "m" or "M" (multiple of 1024 x 1024),
              "g" or "G" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024),
              "t" or "T" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024),
              "p" or "P" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024).
              Examples:
              --tres-per-task=cpu:4
              --tres-per-task=cpu:8,license:ansys:1
              --tres-per-task=gres:gpu:1
              --tres-per-task=gres:gpu:a100:2
              The specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node.  The available trackable resources are configurable by the system administrator.
              NOTE: Invalid TRES for --tres-per-task include bb,billing,energy,fs,mem,node,pages,vmem.

       --uid=<user>
              Attempt  to  submit and/or run a job as user instead of the invoking user id. The invoking user's credentials will be used to check access permissions
              for the target partition. User root may use this option to run jobs as a normal user in a RootOnly partition for example. If run as root, sbatch  will
              drop its permissions to the uid specified after node allocation is successful. user may be the user name or numerical user ID.

       --usage
              Display brief help message and exit.

       --use-min-nodes
              If a range of node counts is given, prefer the smaller count.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase  the  verbosity  of sbatch's informational messages.  Multiple -v's will further increase sbatch's verbosity.  By default only errors will be
              displayed.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -W, --wait
              Do not exit until the submitted job terminates.  The exit code of the sbatch command will be the same as the exit code of the submitted  job.  If  the
              job  terminated due to a signal rather than a normal exit, the exit code will be set to 1.  In the case of a job array, the exit code recorded will be
              the highest value for any task in the job array.

       --wait-all-nodes=<value>
              Controls when the execution of the command begins.  By default the job will begin execution as soon as the allocation is made.

              0    Begin execution as soon as allocation can be made.  Do not wait for all nodes to be ready for use (i.e. booted).

              1    Do not begin execution until all nodes are ready for use.

       --wckey=<wckey>
              Specify wckey to be used with job.  If TrackWCKey=no (default) in the slurm.conf this value is ignored.

       --wrap=<command_string>
              Sbatch will wrap the specified command string in a simple "sh" shell script, and submit that script to the slurm controller.  When --wrap is  used,  a
              script name and arguments may not be specified on the command line; instead the sbatch-generated wrapper script is used.

filename pattern
       sbatch allows for a filename pattern to contain one or more replacement symbols, which are a percent sign "%" followed by a letter (e.g. %j).

       \\     Do not process any of the replacement symbols.

       %%     The character "%".

       %A     Job array's master job allocation number.

       %a     Job array ID (index) number.

       %J     jobid.stepid of the running job. (e.g. "128.0")

       %j     jobid of the running job.

       %N     short hostname. This will create a separate IO file per node.

       %n     Node identifier relative to current job (e.g. "0" is the first node of the running job) This will create a separate IO file per node.

       %s     stepid of the running job.

       %t     task identifier (rank) relative to current job. This will create a separate IO file per task.

       %u     User name.

       %x     Job name.

       A  number placed between the percent character and format specifier may be used to zero-pad the result in the IO filename to at minimum of specified numbers.
       This number is ignored if the format specifier corresponds to non-numeric data (%N for example). The maximal number is 10, if a value greater than 10 is used
       the result is padding up to 10 characters.  Some examples of how the format string may be used for a 4 task job step with a JobID of 128 and step id of 0 are
       included below:

       job%J.out      job128.0.out

       job%4j.out     job0128.out

       job%2j-%2t.out job128-00.out, job128-01.out, ...

PERFORMANCE
       Executing sbatch sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from sbatch or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure  calls  to
       the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it can result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not  run  sbatch  or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that
       programs limit calls to sbatch to the minimum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

INPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Upon startup, sbatch will read and handle the options set in the following environment variables. The majority of these variables are set the  same  way  the
       options  are  set,  as  defined above. For flag options that are defined to expect no argument, the option can be enabled by setting the environment variable
       without a value (empty or NULL string), the string 'yes', or a non-zero number. Any other value for the environment variable will result in  the  option  not
       being set.  There are a couple exceptions to these rules that are noted below.
       NOTE: Environment variables will override any options set in a batch script, and command line options will override any environment variables.

       SBATCH_WCKEY          Same as --wckey

       SLURM_CONF            The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS     Specify debug flags for sbatch to use. See DebugFlags in the slurm.conf(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment  variable
                             takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.

       SLURM_EXIT_ERROR      Specifies the exit code generated when a Slurm error occurs (e.g. invalid options).  This can be used by a script to distinguish appli-
                             cation exit codes from various Slurm error conditions.

       SLURM_STEP_KILLED_MSG_NODE_ID=ID
                             If set, only the specified node will log when the job or step are killed by a signal.

       SLURM_UMASK           If defined, Slurm will use the defined umask to set permissions when creating the output/error files for the job.

OUTPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The Slurm controller will set the following variables in the environment of the batch script.

       SBATCH_MEM_BIND
              Set to value of the --mem-bind option.

       SBATCH_MEM_BIND_LIST
              Set to bit mask used for memory binding.

       SBATCH_MEM_BIND_PREFER
              Set to "prefer" if the --mem-bind option includes the prefer option.

       SBATCH_MEM_BIND_TYPE
              Set to the memory binding type specified with the --mem-bind option.  Possible values are "none", "rank", "map_map", "mask_mem" and "local".

       SBATCH_MEM_BIND_VERBOSE
              Set to "verbose" if the --mem-bind option includes the verbose option.  Set to "quiet" otherwise.

       SLURM_*_HET_GROUP_#
              For a heterogeneous job allocation, the environment variables are set separately for each component.

       SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID

              Job array's index step size.

       SLURM_CLUSTER_NAME
              Name of the cluster on which the job is executing.

       SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE
              Number of CPUs allocated to the batch step.  NOTE: The select/linear plugin allocates entire nodes to jobs, so the value indicates the total count  of
              CPUs on the node.  For the select/cons_res and cons/tres plugins, this number indicates the number of CPUs on this node allocated to the step.

       SLURM_CPUS_PER_GPU
              Number of CPUs requested per allocated GPU.  Only set if the --cpus-per-gpu option is specified.

       SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
              Number of cpus requested per task.  Only set if the --cpus-per-task option is specified.

       SLURM_CONTAINER
              OCI Bundle for job.  Only set if --container is specified.

       SLURM_CONTAINER_ID
              OCI id for job.  Only set if --container-id is specified.

       SLURM_DIST_PLANESIZE
              Plane distribution size. Only set for plane distributions.  See -m, --distribution.

       SLURM_DISTRIBUTION
              Same as -m, --distribution

       SLURM_EXPORT_ENV
              Same as --export.

       SLURM_GPU_BIND
              Requested binding of tasks to GPU.  Only set if the --gpu-bind option is specified.

       SLURM_GPU_FREQ
              Requested GPU frequency.  Only set if the --gpu-freq option is specified.

       SLURM_GPUS
              Number of GPUs requested.  Only set if the -G, --gpus option is specified.

       SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE
              Number of GPUs allocated to the batch step.

       SLURM_GPUS_PER_NODE
              Requested GPU count per allocated node.  Only set if the --gpus-per-node option is specified.

       SLURM_GPUS_PER_SOCKET
              Requested GPU count per allocated socket.  Only set if the --gpus-per-socket option is specified.

       SLURM_GPUS_PER_TASK
              Requested GPU count per allocated task.  Only set if the --gpus-per-task option is specified.

       SLURM_GTIDS
              Global  task  IDs  running on this node.  Zero  origin and comma separated.  It is read internally by pmi if Slurm was built with pmi support. Leaving
              the variable set may cause problems when using external packages from within the job (Abaqus and Ansys have been known to have problems when it is set
              - consult the appropriate documentation for 3rd party software).

       SLURM_HET_SIZE
              Set to count of components in heterogeneous job.

       SLURM_JOB_ACCOUNT
              Account name associated of the job allocation.

       SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE
              Count  of  CPUs  available  to  the job on the nodes in the allocation, using the format CPU_count[(xnumber_of_nodes)][,CPU_count [(xnumber_of_nodes)]
              ...].  For example: SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE='72(x2),36' indicates that on the first and second nodes (as listed by SLURM_JOB_NODELIST) the  allocation
              has  72 CPUs, while the third node has 36 CPUs.  NOTE: The select/linear plugin allocates entire nodes to jobs, so the value indicates the total count
              of CPUs on allocated nodes. The select/cons_res and select/cons_tres plugins allocate individual CPUs to jobs, so this number indicates the number  of
              CPUs allocated to the job.

       SLURM_JOB_DEPENDENCY
              Set to value of the --dependency option.

       SLURM_JOB_END_TIME
              The UNIX timestamp for a job's projected end time.

       SLURM_JOB_GPUS
              The  global  GPU  IDs  of  the  GPUs  allocated  to  this job. The GPU IDs are not relative to any device cgroup, even if devices are constrained with
              task/cgroup.  Only set in batch and interactive jobs.

       SLURM_JOB_ID
              The ID of the job allocation.

       SLURM_JOB_NAME
              Name of the job.

       SLURM_JOB_NODELIST
              List of nodes allocated to the job.

       SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES
              Total number of nodes in the job's resource allocation.

       SLURM_JOB_PARTITION

              volved  in  the  job's  communications from the system's top level switch down to the leaf switch and  ending  with node name. A  period  is  used  to
              separate each hardware component name.

       SLURM_TOPOLOGY_ADDR_PATTERN
              This is set only if the  system  has  the  topology/tree  plugin configured. The value will be set  component  types  listed   in SLURM_TOPOLOGY_ADDR.
              Each  component will be identified as either "switch" or "node".  A period is  used  to separate each hardware component type.

       SLURMD_NODENAME
              Name of the node running the job script.

EXAMPLES
       Specify a batch script by filename on the command line. The batch script specifies a 1 minute time limit for the job.

              $ cat myscript
              #!/bin/sh
              #SBATCH --time=1
              srun hostname |sort

              $ sbatch -N4 myscript
              salloc: Granted job allocation 65537

              $ cat slurm-65537.out
              host1
              host2
              host3
              host4

       Pass a batch script to sbatch on standard input:

              $ sbatch -N4 <<EOF
              > #!/bin/sh
              > srun hostname |sort
              > EOF
              sbatch: Submitted batch job 65541

              $ cat slurm-65541.out
              host1
              host2
              host3
              host4

       To create a heterogeneous job with 3 components, each allocating a unique set of nodes:

              $ sbatch -w node[2-3] : -w node4 : -w node[5-7] work.bash
              Submitted batch job 34987
